## Remembering 
Cognitive scientists have shown that you can actually separate the act of remembering into two different processes.
- Recognition
- Recall

> Recognition is an important memory ability. It’s what happens when you see a bird and know it’s a seagull. It’s what happens when someone says your name and you know they’re talking to you. It’s also what happens when you’re reading. To read this text you must individually recognize each of the words I’ve written.

> Recall, on the other hand, is somewhat different. It’s the ability to pull up the answer to a question, without looking at it. If I ask you the capital of France, and you know the answer, Paris, it’s because you recalled it from memory.

Whenever you’re reading something that you want to remember, take notes. Except, don’t take notes which summarize the main points you want to recall. Instead, take notes which ask questions.

If you wanted to do it with this text, you could write down the question, “**Q: What are the two different memory processes?**” and the answer would be “**A: Recall and recognition.**”
