## EXPERIENCE

---
### Software Developer (CI&T)
April 2023 - Present

- Currently contributing to the development of a subscription product for a client from the US. Using AWS Lambda and Node with Typescript, I am mostly working with API integrations. As the project works a lot "in the background" I am having the opportunity to work with asynchronous process - pub/sub (Solace) -, caching (redis)

- Worked in the integration with a different range of APIs such as Zuora, Salesforce, Signifyd, Gmail.

- Working daily with the AWS stack: Lambda, Step Functions, Gateway, S3, Cloudwatch, as well as CDK with Typescript to define the infrastructure.

- Additionally, I also have been working with the Salesforce CRM, helping develop automations (Flows, Apex, LWC )responsible for implementing business logic and integrations with other systems.


### Software Developer Intern (CI&T)
Feb 2022 - April 2023

- Worked in the API integration with a fraud check system, sending data on different orders steps: fulfillment, return and cancellation. 

- Worked to improve the logging of the project, helping build a new library for it and adding the new log structure in all microservices, enabling a better use of data to build dashboards and allowing the team to monitor the microservices in an external monitoring software.

- Helped build automated tests with Python and Pytest
