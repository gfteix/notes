According to [[Nietzsche]], there is a fundamental human drive â€“ the "will to power." This drive isn't just about dominating others, but also about overcoming challenges and pushing ourselves to grow. It might seem counterintuitive, but according to Nietzsche, we often unconsciously invite struggles into our lives. We might think we're avoiding them, but on a deeper level, we crave them because they fuel our growth. These struggles are the fuel for our "will to power," the very thing that allows us to become stronger versions of ourselves. We may not consciously recognize this desire for struggle, but it's an essential part of the process of self-conquest and empowerment.
"Human beings do not seek pleasure and avoid displeasure. What human beings want, whatever the smallest organism wants, is an increase of power; driven by that will they seek resistance, they need something that opposes it - displeasure, as an obstacle to their will to power, is therefore a normal fact; human beings do not avoid it, they are rather in continual need of it." ~[[Friedrich Nietzsche]]
