A film about a jury of twelve men deciding the guilt of a teenager accused of murdering his own father.


A parricide, a trial, a jury, everything poiting to the guilt of the accused, and as the story unfolds, some doubts arise and there is no longer so much certainty about the guilt. 

Awesome movie. It reminded me a lot of Dmitri's trial in [[Os Irmãos Karamázov|The Brothers Karamazov]]...
