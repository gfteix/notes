**High availability (HA)** is a characteristic of a system that aims to ensure an agreed level of operational performance, usually uptime, for a higher than normal period

A **computer cluster** is a set of computers that work together so that they can be viewed as a single system

A **high availability cluster** is a group of interconnected servers that work together as a single system to ensure continuous availability of critical applications and services


Clustering can be categorized primarily into two types: Active-Active and Active-Passive.

- **Active-Active clusters** involve multiple nodes all handling requests simultaneously. This not only provides redundancy but also enhances the performance of the system by distributing the load.
- **Active-Passive clusters,** on the other hand, consist of active nodes and standby nodes where the standby nodes only come into play if the active ones fail.
