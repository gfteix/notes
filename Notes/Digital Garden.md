> The movement might be gaining steam now, but its roots date back to 1998, when Mark Bernstein introduced the idea of the “[hypertext garden](http://www.eastgate.com/garden/Enter.html),” arguing for spaces on the internet that let a person wade into the unknown. “Gardens … lie between farmland and wilderness,” he [wrote](http://www.eastgate.com/garden/Gardens.html). “The garden is farmland that delights the senses, designed for delight rather than commodity.” (His [digital garden](https://www.markbernstein.org/) includes a recent review of a Bay Area carbonara dish and reflections on his favorite essays.)
